Create a new folder in scratchpad/people/. Document your process. Write down what you do, so that it's not duplicated in the next rounds:
- Learnings.
- Any other important information for the next rounds.

Save every single person that you enrich to scratchpad/people/all_prospects.csv, regardless of whether you find their emails or not.


Read scratchpad/companies/all_prospects.csv. For every company worth contacting:

1. Find every ideal person to reach out to.
2. Find their emails.


Score 1-10 each person. Explain why that score. Cast whether it's worth reaching out to them. Add few notes that I should know about them, that would be useful when reaching out.

As a final output, update spreadsheet: <ID>.
Write down company, name, title., LI page, score, why that score, reach out decision and outreach notes.
Verify that no information was lost.
